# PantrEYE: Developing a Smart Pantry Using Computer Vision and Smart Processing
###### A TJHSST Computer Systems Lab Senior Research Lab Project // Rishabh Misra; Period 2 Syslab 2019-2020

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a smart pantry application based on computer vision techniques, in order to help users keep track of what is in their pantries, get alerts on when something is missing or runs out, get information about pantry food items, and more.

## Requirements
A Raspberry Pi 4+ set up with Ubuntu (I recommend a CanaKit Raspberry Pi 4 Starter Kit - makes the setup process very easy) is necessary for this project. All requierments below are for the Raspberry Pi environment. 

This project requires Python 3+.
Various required python modules are listed below. To install any of these, type
```
  pip install [modulename]
```
 - cv2 (OpenCV 2)
 - pyzbar
 - argparse
 - imutils
 - subprocess
 
 ## Installation Instructions
 1. Set up the Raspberry Pi with Ubuntu and ensure there are no problems with that. For help with doing this, consult the guide that was present in the starter kit you purchased if you used one or consult https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up. 
 2. Clone this respository into whichever directory you desire.
